# A script to copy files outside of the bazel cache
# In order for this to work, sandboxing has to be disabled
#
# The BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY env variable is automatically injected by bazel when 
# doing `bazel run`. See: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#run
#
# But if this rule is executed doing `bazel test`, the BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY
# is not automatically injected by bazel, and instead it should be passed from 
# command line when running bazel. For example:
# ```
# bazel test --test_env=BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY="$(PWD)" <YOUR_TARGET_HERE>
# ```
#

If you are running this rule as a test type, you need to inject the BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY
environmental variable manually. For example:
> bazel test --test_env=BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY="$(PWD)" <YOUR_TARGET_HERE>;
